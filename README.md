Account Management: Tracks different financial accounts (e.g., bank accounts) and their initial balances.

Category Management: Defining custom categories and subcategories for income and expenses.

Transaction Tracking: Logging income and expenses, assigning them to an account and category.

Master Dashboard: Provides a combined overview of all financial workspaces at once.
